# BOOKIT-HOTEL BOOKING Web Application

This project is built to get hands-on experience on NextJs technology which is gaining pace. In this web application, I write to mimic all basic functionality which any web application needs. Please look into the features section for a detailed outline. The demo of project is available here [bookit-hotelWebApp](http://)

Note- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Welcome to [Your Project Name], a full-stack Hotel Booking Application built with Next.js. This project showcases the power of Next.js by leveraging its key features:

- **File-based routing**

- Authentication using `next-auth`
- Integration with Stripe Payment Gateway for secure transactions
- Server-side state management using Redux
- Room booking management
- User reviews for rooms

## Technology Stack

1. Next.js for the frontend framework
2. next-auth for authentication
3. Redux for state management
4. Stripe for payment processing
5. MongoDB for data storage
6. Cloudinary for image hosting

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
